# Laravel Metronic Inertia Vue Demo1

This project demonstrates the integration of **Laravel 12**, **Inertia.js**, and **Vue 3** with the **Metronic Admin Template (Demo1)**. It combines the power of Laravel for the backend with Vue 3 and Inertia.js for the frontend, offering a seamless full-stack application experience without the need for traditional API endpoints.

## Features

- **Laravel 12**: The backend framework that handles routing, controllers, authentication, and database interactions.
- **Metronic Template (Demo1)**: A fully responsive and modern admin dashboard template used for the frontend design.
- **Inertia.js**: A modern JavaScript framework that allows server-side routing to be used within single-page applications, providing an SPA-like experience without requiring a traditional API.
- **Vue 3**: A JavaScript framework used for creating interactive user interfaces. Integrated with Inertia.js for dynamic frontend rendering.

## Project Structure

- **app/**: Contains Laravel backend code (models, controllers, services, etc.).
- **resources/js/**: Contains Vue 3 components, Inertia.js setup, and frontend logic.
- **public/**: Publicly accessible files, including Metronic assets (CSS, JS).
- **routes/**: Laravel routes (web.php and api.php for any API routes).
- **config/**: Configuration files for the Laravel application.
- **database/migrations/**: Database migration files to set up the necessary database structure.

## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **PHP 8.1+** (recommended)
- **Composer** (for PHP package management)
- **Node.js** and **npm** (for frontend dependencies)
- **MySQL/MariaDB/PostgreSQL** or any supported Laravel database system

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/laravel-metronic-inertia-vue-demo1.git
cd laravel-metronic-inertia-vue-demo1
```

### 2. Install Backend Dependencies

Ensure you have **Composer** installed. Then, run the following command to install Laravel's backend dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Set up Environment Variables

Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. Then, configure your database connection and any other necessary environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Make sure to update the database settings, such as DB_CONNECTION, DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, and DB_PASSWORD, to match your local database setup.

### 4. Generate the Application Key

Run the following command to generate a new application key for Laravel:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 5. Migrate the Database

Set up your database by running the migrations. This will create the necessary tables in your database.

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 6. Install Frontend Dependencies

Ensure **Node.js** and **npm** (or Yarn) are installed. Then, install the necessary frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 7. Build Assets

Before running the app, build the assets for the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### 8. Run Development Server

Start the Laravel development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Then, open another terminal window and run the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Your application should now be accessible at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Folder Structure

The project follows a clean and organized folder structure:

- **app/**: Contains Laravel backend logic (controllers, models, services).
- **database/migrations/**: Database migrations for setting up the tables.
- **resources/js/**: Vue components and Inertia.js configuration files.
  - **Pages/**: Vue components representing each page (e.g., Dashboard.vue, Profile.vue).
  - **Components/**: Reusable components (e.g., Sidebar.vue, Navbar.vue).
  - **Layouts/**: Layout components used across different pages.
- **public/**: Contains the Metronic template assets like CSS, JS, and images.
- **routes/web.php**: The main route file where the server-side routes are defined.
- **config/**: Configuration files for Laravel, such as the database and session settings.

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel 12**: The PHP framework for backend logic and database management.
- **Vue 3**: JavaScript framework for building the frontend user interface.
- **Inertia.js**: JavaScript library that connects Laravel with Vue to allow for server-side routing in single-page applications.
- **Metronic Template (Demo1)**: Responsive and feature-rich admin dashboard template.
- **Tailwind CSS** (optional, if you're using it with Metronic for styling).

## Customization

You can customize the application by editing the following files:

- **resources/ts/**: Modify Vue components, pages, and layout files.
- **app/**: Update controllers and models to fit your business logic.
- **config/**: Configure environment-specific settings in the `.env` and `config/` files.
- **public/**: Replace Metronic assets or modify styles as needed.

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
php artisan test
```

Make sure your database is set up and the migrations are applied before running the tests.
